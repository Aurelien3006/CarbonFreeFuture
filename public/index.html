      <h1>What is a carbon footprint? </h1>
      <section>
        <p class="paragraph">
          A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.
          The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world.
          Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons.
          To have the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.
          Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons does not happen overnight!
          By making small changes to our actions, like eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.
