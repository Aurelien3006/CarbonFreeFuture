    <h1>What is a carbon footprint? </h1>
    <section>
      <p class="paragraph">
        A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions. 
        The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. 
        Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. 
        To have the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050. 
        Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons does not happen overnight! 
        By making small changes to our actions, like eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.
